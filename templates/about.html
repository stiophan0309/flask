<h2>About</h2>
<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree 
    which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. 
    (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and 
    took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels 
    in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that 
    stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone 
    like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. 
    The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as 
    Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into 
    their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. 
        Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. 
        While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of 
        Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. 
        At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the 
        epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.</p>

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. 
            They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thror. 
            Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.[2]

            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes so they were often sent scouting or searching. 
            They found the Goblins' cave in the Misty Mountains.[3]

            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[4] They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, 
                traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.[5] The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.[6]

            At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.[7]

            Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of the Five Armies, and all three were buried with honor.
